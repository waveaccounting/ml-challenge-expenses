## A paragraph or two about what algorithm was chosen for which problem, why (including pros/cons) and what you are particularly proud of in your implementation, and why
I've chosen `SGDClassifier` algorithm as my final decision to solve this text processing (NLP) classification problem as `SGDClassifier` stands out among all three text processing algorithms I recently studied after cross validating and tuning the parameter against training data. Those three algorithms are `OneVsRestClassifier with LinearSVC`, `MultinomialNB`, and `SGDClassifier`. 

What I'm proud of this solution is that I came from no experience of ML and took 2-3 days to study the basics, then was able to compare 3 different algorithms with cross validating and parameter tuning to get a sense of which performs better towards which problem (my take would be this is a text processing classification problem). 

I might just scratch the surface as I know text processing can go really deep into Neural Networks, but I'm pretty satisfied with I'm accomplished within these couple days.


## Overall performance of your algorithm(s)
After examining all three algorithms, They all have accuracy of 0.91666 (after tuning two of them).
However, sincee SGDClassifier has better result with k-fold cross validation, mean:0.884615 (std:0.210663),

| K-Fold metric        | mean           | (std)  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| SVC      | 0.846154  | (0.230769) |
| NB      | 0.692308       |   (0.417799) |
| SGD | 0.884615       |    (0.210663) |


I'd pick SGDClassifier algorithm as my first choice to train the model.


As for potential personal and business expenses, the assumption I make is that from the `expense description`, if there's certain keywords, like `personal`, `family`, `families` (Can be further implemented using stemming), I'd clean the data by wiping out the `expense description` to reduce the word count.

Since there's no such keywords in training data, the results come back the same. I might need to study more on this area as I'm not so sure about the approach to take from here.


## Next Steps:
  - since this is text processing classificaiton and NLP problem, we can even tune with stop words and stemming.
  - find more text processing classification algorithm and compare them through the same process.
  - try Neural Networks approach using deep learning.
