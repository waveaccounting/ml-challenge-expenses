    "The clustering solution tries to address the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mixing of personal and business expenses is a common problem for small business. Create an algorithm that can separate any potential personal expenses in the training data. Labels of personal and business expenses were deliberately not given as this is often the case in our system. There is no right answer so it is important you provide any assumptions you have made.*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we will use K-means clustering for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For distinguishing personal expenses from business expenses, we are going to make the following **assumptions** (**none of those are necessarily true in all cases**):\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the date of expenses is on weekeends or holidays, it is more likely to be a personal expense (notice, however, the flaw of this assumption is that an expense on Friday night might very well be personal)\n",
    "- Higher expense amount has more chance of being a business expense\n",
    "- The text fields along with the previous 2 criteria (expense description and category) can possibly give us some clue about the type of expense. For example, category **office supplies** and **Computer Hardware** has more chance of being a business expense, whereas **Meals and Entertainment** with a relatively low expense amount has a higher chance of being a personal expense, especially if it is on a weekend.\n",
    "- Employee ID might useful as well since certain employees might have certain habits of making personal or business type expenses.\n",
    "- Same goes for role.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Though not shown in this notebook, later I have found that excluding employee id and role does not alter the resulting clusters)"
